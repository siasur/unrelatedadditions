Unrelated Additions is a collection of blocks, items and tools that my friends and I were missing in our current 1.19 world. There is no theme or connection between the various added things.

 

So far this mod includes:

1. Magnet  
The magnet (when enabled, via SHIFT + right click) increases the pickup range up to three blocks around the player (other mods can exclude items from this using the tag forge:magnet_blacklist)  

2. Hammer  
Hammer come in all usual tool materials except Netherite, they are breaking a 3x3x1 area around the center block, at the moment they act like a pickaxe AND a shovel, this will probably change in the future and I'll create a big shovel too.  

3. Tiny (Char) Coal  
Annoyed when you have 7 ores or raw meat that you need to smelt but don't want to waste the tiny bit of coal for the 8th item? Well break your coal into 8 pieces and smelt 1 item with each.  

4. Compressed Block  
Are your chests overflowing with cobble, cobbled deepslate, dirt, (red) sand, gravel or even Granite, Diorite, Andesite? Just put 9 of the same block into the crafting table and compress them.  
    Each block can be compressed up to a certain point  
    - Cobble and Cobbled Deepslate: 6 times
    - Dirt, Sand, Red Sand: 3 times
    - Gravel: 2 times
    - Granite, Diorite, Andesite: 1 time





Everything added in this mod - at moment of implementation - either

 - comes from a mod that hasn't been ported to 1.19 yet
 - or was just something I wanted to implement myself regardles of (non)exitence in other mods.

 

I'm open to suggestions but I won't promise to implement everything.

(I'm not an artist, all textures are to be considered "dev textures". If this gets traction and grows further I may invest in some proper textures)
